# Homework 12: Eat-Da-Burger! 
This is Taylor Johnson's Homework 12 - Eat-Da-Burger! for the Georgia Tech Coding Boot Camp.

Eat-Da-Burger! is a simple Express web application which utilizes a MySQL data source, an Express/Node backend, and jQuery/Bootstrap frontend. The application retrieves a list of burgers from the database that have not been eaten yet or devoured by invoking the Burgers API GET request. These burgers are displayed to the user in the Burger Queue displayed in the browser.

If the user wants to eat a specific burger, then he can click the Devour button next to the burger. This will move the devoured burger to the Devoured Burgers list. It will also update the devoured boolean in the database for the burger by invoking the Burgers API PUT request. If the application reloads, the burger will no longer display in the Burger Queue.

If the user wants to add a burger to the Burger Queue, he can do so by entering the name of the burger in the form and clicking the Add Burger button. The burger will then be added to the Burger Queue. It will also be added to the database by invoking the Burgers API POST request.
